# Web Interface

pbnj includes a web interface for creating and managing pastes directly from your browser.

## Authentication

The web interface uses secure session-based authentication:

- **Login**: Enter your `AUTH_KEY` to create a session
- **Sessions**: Stored server-side in D1, expire after 30 days
- **Cookies**: HttpOnly session cookie (can't be accessed by JavaScript)
- **Security**: Your auth key is never stored in the browser after login

This is more secure than storing credentials in localStorage, as the actual auth key is only used once during login.

### Header Icons

The header displays different icons based on your login state:

| Icon | State | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| Peanut | Logged out | Click to go to login page |
| Bread | Logged in | Click to create a new paste |
| Jelly | Logged in | Click to log out |

## Login

1. Click the peanut icon in the header (or navigate to `/login`)
2. Enter your `AUTH_KEY`
3. Press Enter or click the arrow button

After logging in, you'll be redirected back to the page you came from.

## Creating Pastes

When logged in, click the bread icon in the header to create a new paste.

### New Paste Page

The `/new` page provides a simple editor with these options:

- **Filename** - Optional name for your paste (defaults to "snippet")
- **Language** - Select language for syntax highlighting (or leave as "auto")
- **Private** - Toggle to make the paste unlisted (won't appear on homepage)
- **Save** - Click or press `Cmd/Ctrl + S` to save

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd/Ctrl + S` | Save paste |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` | Save paste |

## Deleting Pastes

When logged in, a trash icon appears on paste view pages. Click it to delete the paste immediately.

The delete button appears in:
- Desktop: Rightmost button in the action bar
- Mobile: At the bottom of the dropdown menu

## Logout

Click the jelly icon in the header to log out. This invalidates your session on the server and clears the session cookie.

## Private Pastes on Homepage

When logged in, the homepage shows all your pastes including private ones. Private pastes are marked with a lock icon (🔒). When logged out, only public pastes are visible.
